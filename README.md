Packrat
*******

Packrat is a client for the Packstation site of Deutsche Post. You can list
past and present deliveries from the last six month and look up tracking 
numbers for them if available. It integrates well with the excellent Delivery
Status Touch and supports Push notifications. It runs on the iPhone and the
iPod Touch.
